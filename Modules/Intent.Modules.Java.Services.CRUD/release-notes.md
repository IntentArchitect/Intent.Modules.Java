### Version 3.5.0

- Supports new CRUD approach which is agnostic to whether the services are exposed as Http Endpoints or not.

### Version 3.3.12

- Implementations will no longer generate code which causes compilation errors when classes in the domain designer have been modelled starting with a lower case letter.

### Version 3.3.11

- Updated module description.

### Version 3.3.10

- Fixed: Setting a surrogate key type as a return type for the Create CRUD operation will now return the newly created Entity's Identifier.
